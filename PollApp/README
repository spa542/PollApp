Command Line Poll App
8/12/20

Project Description:
This project is a command line polling app (similar to straw poll). The
program uses PostgreSQL to manage 3 large databases including open 
polls, options, and votes. The entire database is managed and accessed
using the object oriented approach and allows users to create polls, vote
on existing polls, and select winners for polls based off tallied votes.
Some interesting features included are analytics for each poll as well as
timestamps for when votes are submitted.

Dependencies:
**These are specified in requirements.txt but will also be specified here
 - psycopg2-binary
 - python-dotenv
 - python 3.6 or above

To install dependencies:
    "pip3 install (dependency listed above)"

How to run:
To run this program, you simply must run the app.py script. There will be
a .env.example file provided if you would like enter the DATABASE_URL 
in that file instead of on the spot on the command line. Once the DATABASE_URL
is registered, the menu will run and full use of the app will be available. 
(This app was tested using a free postgresql service called elephantsql)

Sample execution:
 "python3 app.py"
